# PigLatinLanguage
This is a funny word translator that will convert words into a secret code called Pig Latin. This program combines my knowledge of loops.

** Pig Latin is a simple joke language (more like imaginary lol) that makes regular words hard to understand. It works by taking the first few consonants cluster of a word and moving them to the end of the word and adding "ay" to the end as well. For example Duck = uckDay, Glove = oveGlay, Pig = igPay, Happy = appyHay and so on.  
If the word begins with a vowel, then you just simply add 'yay' to the end. For example, apple = appleyay, eat = eatyay. 

So with these two simple rules, this program will ask the user for a sentence and then convert the entire sentence into pig latin.




##Steps To Run This Program a. You need to have python installed on your computer.
b. Clone this repository on your local machine. c. Double-click on PigLatin.py
